### Summary
Based on the data from the NYC CitiBike company, the heavy tourist area would be a good place to start in Des Moines. Another place could be downtown for the bike sharing company. The target audience would be Male subcribers. Customers would be the company's Saturday business. 
The client should as add a graph to show the Start station names with the number of starts. This could help determine how many bikes to place at each location. 
Another graph the client could add is usertype per location. This could help determine which usertype is using the bikes at a location more.
